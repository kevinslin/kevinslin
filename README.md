I'm **Kevin**. I'm a software engineer that's been obsessed with PKM for the last decade - mostly for personal reasons as I needed a tool that could help me make use of my own corpus of **+30K notes**. 

After a decade of experimenting, I found that existing workflows and tools  (sometimes) made it easy to create notes but past the 1K note threshold, made it [impossible to find again](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/e1455752-b052-4212-ac6e-cc054659f2bb).

This led me to create my own workflow - [A Hierarchy First Approach to Note Taking](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64). This workflow, combined with custom tooling I created to facilitate it, **completely solved information overload** for myself, allowing me to easily create, organize and reference my own knowledge.

In 2019, I left my job at Amazon to focus on distilling everything I had learned about PKM to build [Dendron](https://dendron.so/) - a [tool for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) that helps **humans** manage **knowledge at scale**. I went through YC W21 as a solo founder and built Dendron out to over 100K users before winding down due to some family issues. 

Currently I work at OpenAI where I work on building tools of thought with AI.
